# 🎬 Box Office & Market Analysis Project
This project merges movie‑level box office data with industry metrics by year, enabling analysis of domestic vs foreign revenue shares, ticket sales, inflation‑adjusted totals, and average ticket prices. Cleaned numeric values make the dataset ready for aggregation, visualization, and trend exploration across time.

This projects primary focus was to incorporate data wrangling skills using python language on jupyter notebook and combine that with web scraping skills.
